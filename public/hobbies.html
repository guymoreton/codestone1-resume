            <li><strong>Playing football</strong> - I am a player/club secretary for a local football team that me and a few friends decided to start up as a way to make sure that we all stay in touch once or twice a week whilst also havong fun and excercising.</li> <br />

            <li><strong>Learning Languages</strong> - Away from learning coding languages, I also enjoy learning other languages from different countries in my spare time. This is more of a recent one for me, starting off with spanish which I am hoping to be fluent in by the end of 2026.</li>
            
            <br />
            
            <li><strong>Travelling</strong> - This is probably my favourite thing to do in life, I have a lifelong dream to visit every country in the world. I enjoy learning about different cultures whilst also trying my hardest to partake in them while im there. Travelling with my friends provides me with the greatest memories you can ask for, and ones you can tell the grandkids someday.</li>
